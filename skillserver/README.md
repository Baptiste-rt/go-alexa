## `go-alexa/skillserver`

A simple Go framework to quickly create an Amazon Alexa Skills web service.

### What?

After beta testing the Amazon Echo (and it's voice assistant Alexa) for several months, Amazon has released the product to the public and created an SDK for developers to add new "Alexa Skills" to the product.

You can see the SDK documentation here: [developer.amazon.com/public/solutions/alexa/alexa-skills-kit](https://developer.amazon.com/public/solutions/alexa/alexa-skills-kit) but in short, a developer can make a web service that allows a user to say _Alexa, ask [your service] to [some action your service provides]`
